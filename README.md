## Hi there 👋

**Note:** I inadvertently deleted the version 2.7.6 dmg file and subsequently re-added it. The download count was reset, and the number of downloads before re-addition was about 1,000 downloads. The version 2.7.7rc3 will serve as a release candidate for a limited period, allowing users to identify and report any potential issues prior to the official release.

If you find RsyncUI useful, I would appreciate it if you could consider giving me a star. Each star serves as motivation for me to continue developing RsyncUI.

This is the repository for RsyncUI, a SwiftUI based macOS application. RsyncUI is released for *macOS Sonoma and later*. RsyncUI is a GUI on the Apple macOS platform for the command line tool [rsync](https://github.com/WayneD/rsync). It is `rsync` which executes the synchronize data tasks. The GUI is *only* for organizing tasks, setting parameters to `rsync` and make it easier to use `rsync`.

The [user documentation](https://rsyncui.netlify.app/docs/)([repo](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/rsyncuidocs)) is based upon a fork of the excellent Hugo based theme [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy). RsyncUI might be installed by Homebrew or by direct download. It is *signed* and *notarized* by Apple.

| Homebrew | macOS versions |   Latest version   |
